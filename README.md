# Prophet-Demon Adversarial Learning

Exploring final size predictions on contact networks using adversarial learning.

## Implementation

Currently only the Prophet model is implemented.

To train the Prophet on Erdos-Renyi random graphs use: *train_prophet.py*

To train the Prophet on Watts-Strogatz small world networks use: *train_prophet_watts.py*

*EpiNetSim.py* simulates epidemics on contact networks using the Gillespie stochastic simulation algorithm.
